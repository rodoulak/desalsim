In **desalsim** package, the TCr unit is used to model the operation of a Thermal crystallizer  technology. Upon simulation, it will generate the influent/effluent mass flows and their concentrations, the cooling water, and the energy requirements.
The TCr function consists of three classes: ['thermal_calc'](#use-thermal_calc-class), ['conc_cal'](#use-conc_cal-class), ['calculate_energy'](#use-calculate_energy-class).  
In this tutorial, we will focus on how to use the the classes and their methods. 

**Table 1** gives an overview of the main inputs and outputs for each process unit of Thermal crystallizer .

The mathematical description of Thermal Crystallizer technology is given in [Mathematical description](https://github.com/rodoulak/Desalination-and-Brine-Treatment-Simulation-/tree/main/paper/Mathematical_description.pdf), see Section A.3. 

## 1. Getting started 
### 1.1. Import class
```python
import desalsim
```
Then import the class:  
```python
from desalsim.thermal_cryst_f import thermal_calc
from desalsim.thermal_cryst_f import conc_cal
from desalsim.thermal_cryst_f import calculate_energy
```
Additionally, function for calculating density (`density_calc.py`) need to be imported or constants (comparison.py) where user can add constant values like MW, prices etc, need to be imported.
```python
from desalsim.density_calc import density_calc 
from desalsim import constants 
from desalsim import scaleup
```
### 1.2. Define feed characteristics
You can initialize the feed solution by setting the flow rate, specifying the focus components and their concentration. 
```python
  # Feed concentration
components = ['Na', 'Cl', 'K', 'Mg', 'Ca', 'SO4']
Cf_tcr_in=[80.42, 116.69, 2.29, 0.01, 0.04, 0.54]
# Total salt concentration (g/L)
Cf_s=sum(Cf_tcr_in)

# CaSO4 concentration in feed solution (g/L)
Cf_caso4=Cf_tcr_in[4]*MW_Caso4/MW_Ca

#Feed flow rate 
Qf=1000 #kg/h

# input conditions 
T_in=40 #oC
```
> [!NOTE]
> Note that if you want to add more components, you need to update the components list and include the concentration of the new component in the _Cf_tcr_in_. 

You can calculate the density of the feed solution:
```python
d_sol=density_calc(T_in, Cf_s)/1000 #density of feed

```
### 1.3. Set operating assumptions  
You need to set operating assumptions related to temperatures such as the temperature in the last effect, the intake/outake cooling water temperature. Additionally, the moinsture in salt stream needs to be set.
```python
# Assumptions:
T_in=40 # (oC)
T_cw_f=25 #intake cooling water temperature (oC)
T_cw_o=40 #out cooling water temperature (oC)
T_op=60 # Operating temperature (oC)

salt_mois=20 # % moinsture in salt stream (units: %)
```
#### Thermodyanamic data 
The latent heat of motive steam and vapor is calculated based on steam tables. 
```python
# 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑡 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑒𝑟 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛t
UA=45990
LHV_v=2199.7#2107.92 # kj/kg (gathered from steam table)
LHV_s=2357.69 # kj/kg (gathered from steam table)
```
Finally, you need to set assumptions related to pumping like pressure drop (_dp_) and pump efficiency (_npump_). 
```python
dp=0.1 # pressure drop (units: bar)
dp_slurry=3.5 #pressure drop for slurry streams (units: bar)
dp_f=3.5 #pressure drop for feed (units: bar)
dp_w=1 #pressure drop for qater streams (units: bar)
dp_cw=2 #pressure drop for cooling water (units: bar)

npump=0.8 #pump efficiency (units: -)
```
### 1.4. Set constants 
You need to set constant parameters like the specific heat capacity of water
```python
Cp_f=3.14 # Feed specific heat capacity (units: KJ* Kg*oC)
CP_cw=4.187 # Water specific heat capacity (units: KJ* Kg*oC)
```
After setting all the required inputs, then you can create the functions' objectives. 

## 2. Use thermal_calc class

It doesn't take additional inputs. 
### 2.3.1. Assigned the results to output parameters 
After the mass calculation, you can assigned the results to output parameters: 
```python

For this calculation, you need to use the solution flow rate (_Qf_), the mass of solid stream (_solid_mass_), the name of ion and its concentration in the stream (_C1, Cc1, C2, Cc2, C3, Cc3, C4, Cc4, C5, Cc5, C6, Cc6_).   
### 3.1. Oveview
The following attributes are available within the conc_cal class:  
- `Qf`: Flow rate (units: m³/h)

```
### 4.3. Print results

```python
print(f"SEC_el_prod is {SEC_el_w} KWh/m3 product")
print(f"SEC_el_prod2 is {SEC_el_NaCl} KWh/kg of NaCl product")
print("SEC_th_prod is "+str( round((E_th_th_Cr/(Qf/1000)),2))+" KWh/m3 intake")
```
SEC_el_prod is 5.02 KWh/m3 product  
SEC_el_prod2 is 23.06 KWh/kg of NaCl product  
SEC_th_prod is 628.34 KWh/m3 intake
