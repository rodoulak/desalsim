In **desalsim** package, the MED unit is used to model the operation of a Multi-effect distillation technology. Upon simulation, it will generate the influent/effluent mass flows and their concentrations, the cooling water, and the energy requirements.
The MED function consists of one class: [MEDCalculator](#use-medalculator-class) that constsis.  
In this tutorial, we will focus on how to use the the class and their methods. 

**Table 1** gives an overview of the main inputs and outputs for each process unit of Multi-effect distillation.

The mathematical description of Multi-effect distillation technology is given in [Mathematical description](https://github.com/rodoulak/Desalination-and-Brine-Treatment-Simulation-/tree/main/paper/Mathematical_description.pdf), see Section A.2. 

## 1. Getting started 
### 1.1. Import class
```python
import desalsim
```
Then import the class:  
```python
from desalsim.med_unit_f import MEDCalculator
```
Additionally, function for calculating density (`density_calc.py`) need to be imported. 
```python
from desalsim.density_calc import density_calc
```
### 1.2. Define feed characteristics
You can initialize the feed solution by setting the flow rate, specifying the focus components and their concentration. 
```python
  #Feed concentration
components = ['Na', 'Cl', 'K', 'Mg', 'Ca', 'SO4']
Cin_med = [10.36, 15.39, 0.36, 0.028, 0.02, 0.07]

#Feed flow rate 
Qf_med =1000 #l/hr

#input conditions
T=20
```
> [!NOTE]
> Note that if you want to add more components, you need to update the components list and include the concentration of the new component in the _Ciin_med_. 

You can calculate the density of the feed solution and the mass flow rate:
```python
d=density_calc(T, sum(Cin_med))

# Mass flow rate (units: kg/hr)
Mf_med=Qf_med*d/1000 
```
### 1.3. Set operating assumptions  
You need to set operating assumptions related to temperatures such as the temperature in the last effect, the intake/outake cooling water temperature etc.  
```python
# Assumptions:
T_in=40 #(oC)
T_N=45 #Temperature in the last effect (oC)
T_cw_in=25 #intake cooling water temperature (oC)
T_cw_out=35 #out cooling water temperature (oC)
T_s=70 #steam temperature oC
DT_loss=1 #temperature difference (oC)
T3=69
```
#### Calculate latent heat of motive steam
The latent heat of motive steam is calculated based on the set steam temperature and steam tables. 
```python
#latent heat of motive steam:
if T_s<=55:
    lh_s=2370
elif T_s>55 and T_s<=60:
    lh_s=2358
elif (T_s>60) and (T_s<=65):
    lh_s=2345
elif (T_s>65) and (T_s<=70):
    lh_s=2333
elif (T_s>70) and (T_s<=75):
    lh_s=2321
```

Additionally, you need to define the aimed brine vonventration leaving effect n (_Cb_out_) and the brine circulation flow rate (_Xr_), and the number of effects (_N_). 
```python
Cb_out=200 #Brine Concentration leaving effect n (unit: g/l)
Xr=5.5 # brine circulation flow rate (units: -)
N=2 #Number of effects (-)
```
Finally, you need to set assumptions related to pumping like pressure drop (_dp_) and pump efficiency (_npump_). 
```python
dp=0.1  # pressure drop (units: bar)
dp_slurry=1 # pressure drop (units: bar)
npump=0.8 #pump efficiency (units: -)
```
### 1.4. Set constants 
You need to set constant parameters like the specific heat capacity of water
```python
Cp_w=4182 # specific heat capacity of water (j/kgC)
cp_sol=4184 # specific heat capacity of solution (j/kgC)
```
After setting all the required inputs, then you can create the functions' objectives. 

## 2. Use MEDCalculator class   
MEDCalculator is a class used to represent Mass Balance for MED Unit. In particular, it calculates the permeate and concentrate flow rates, and their ion concentrations. 
MEDCalculator takes as input the names of components (_comp_), the ion concentration in the feed (_C_in_), the rejection rates of the ions (_rjr_values_), the % of water recovery (_Wrec_) and the feed flow rate (_Qf_).  
### 2.1. Overview 
The following attributes are available within the MEDCalculator class:  
- `Qf`: (float) Flow rate (m^3/s).
- `CNa_in, CCl_in, CK_in, CMg_in, CCa_in, CSO4_in` : float
        Initial concentrations of various ions (g/l).

The MEDCalculator class provides the following method:
```python
calculate_perm()
```
This method calculates the permeate and concentrate flow rates, as well as their corresponding ion concentrations based on the provided attributes. It is automatically called upon initialization of the class instance.

### 2.2. Create MEDCalculator objects
MEDCalculator takes as input the feed volumetric flow rate (_Qf_med_) and mass flow rate (_Mf_med_), the concentration in the feed for the components (_CNa_in, CCl_in, CK_in, CMg_in, CCa_in, CSO4_in_) and the 
 Cin_med[0], Cin_med[1], Cin_med[2], Cin_med[3], Cin_med[4], Cin_med[5], and the inlet temperature (_T_in_). 
 
```python
# Create an instance of the MEDCalculator class
med_dat = MEDCalculator(Qf_med, Mf_med, Cin_med[0], Cin_med[1], Cin_med[2], Cin_med[3], Cin_med[4], Cin_med[5], T_in)
```

### 2.3. Use 'salinity_calc' method 
This method calculates the inflow salinity. 
```python
med_dat.salinity_calc()
```
It doesn't take additional inputs. 

### 2.4. Use 'temperature_calc' method 
This method calculate temperature-related parameters and it takes as input the temperature difference (_DT_loss_), temperature in the last effect (_T_N_), and steam temperature (_T_s). 
```python
med_dat.temperature_calc(DT_loss, T_N, T_s)
```

### 2.5. Use 'mass_balance_med' method 
This method performs mass balance calculations. In particular, it calculates the brine flow rate of leaving effect n (_Bn_, _Qb_), and the total distillate flow rate (_Mdist_, Qdist_). 

```python
 med_dat.mass_balance_med(Cb_out)
```

### 2.4.1. Assigned the results to output parameters 
After the mass calculation, you can assigned the results to output parameters: 
```python
#Brine flow rate 
Qout_med=med_dat.Qb

#Distillate water flow rate 
Qprod_med=med_dat.Qdist

#Calculate circulation flow rate 
Qr=Xr*Qf_med
```



### 2.6. Use 'performance_parameters' method 
It calculates the performance parameters _Gain Output Ratio (GOR)_, _Condenser thermal load (Qc)_, _Cooling water flow rate (Qw)_, _Performance ratio (PR)_, _Condenser thermal load (Qsen)_, _Total thermal load_. 
It takes as input the latent heat of motive steam (_lh_s_) and the intake cooling water temperature (_T_cw_in_). 
```python
med_dat.performance_parameters(lh_s,  T_cw_in)
```

### 2.6.1. Assigned the results to output parameters 
You can assigned the results to output parameters: 
```python
# Calculate required cooling water 
Qcw = med_dat.QCW * 3600 #units: kg/hr

# Calculate thermal energy consumption
E_th_med = med_dat.Q_Tot
```

Then the Energy consumption of the technology and the specific energy consumption can be calculated: 
```python
# Calculate energy consumption
# Electrical energy consumption
E_el_med = ((Qf_med * 3.5 + med_dat.QCW * 3600 * 2 + (Qr + med_dat.Qb) * 3.5 + med_dat.Qdist * 1) / (1000 * npump)) * 1e5 / 3600 / 1000  # kWh

# Specific energy consumption (electrical) per m3 feed
SEC_el = E_el_med / (Qf_med / d)  # kWh/m3 feed

# Specific energy consumption (electrical) per m3 product (distilled water)
SEC_el_prod = E_el_med / (med_dat.Qdist / 1000)  # kWh/m3 dist water
 
# Total thermal energy consumption
E_th_med = med_dat.Q_Tot
# Specific thermal energy consumption  per m3 feed (kWh_th/m3)
SEC_th = E_th_med / (Qf_med / d) 
```
### 2.7. Use 'output_concentration' method 
It calculates the ion concentration in the output, g/l. 
```python
med_dat.output_concentration()
```
It doesn't take additional inputs. 

### 2.7.1. Assigned the results to output parameters 
You can assigned the results to output parameters: 
```python
#Concentration of brine stream 
Cconc_med = [med_dat.CNa_out, med_dat.CCl_out, med_dat.CK_out, med_dat.CMg_out, med_dat.CCa_out, med_dat.CSO4_out]
```
and calculate the density for brine stream 
```python
# Calculate density for output concentration
d_b = density_calc(45, sum(Cconc_med))
```

### 2.8. Print results 
You can print results from mass calculations 
```python
# Flow rates and concentration 
print("Brine flow rate: "+ str(round(Qout_med,2))+"kg/hr")
print("Total distillate flow rate: "+ str(round(Qprod_med,2))+"kg/hr") 
print("Sum of output concentrations: " + str(round(sum(Cconc_med),2))+"g/l")
print("-----------------------------------------")

# Calculate energy consumption
print("Electrical energy consumption: " + str(round(E_el_med,2)) + " kWh")
print("Specific energy consumption (electrical) per m3 feed: " + str(round(SEC_el,2)) + " kWh/m3")
print("Specific energy consumption (electrical) per m3 product (distilled water): " + str(round(SEC_el_prod,2)) + " kWh/m3")
print("-----------------------------------------")


print("Total thermal energy consumption: " + str(round(E_th_med,2)) + " kW")
